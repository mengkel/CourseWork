# CourseWork
Here I will finish my final project. 
To be more specific, I will do some r-process calculations with a constant entropy and a entropy generation celculation.I will try to analyse the importance of entropy.

**Compare the out put abundances of this teo calculation**

the left one is constant entropy, the right one is the calculation with entropy genration but without beta decay process
